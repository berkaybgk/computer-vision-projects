This repository is the collection of Computer Vision projects and experiments I have worked on while taking the master's course CMPE537 as a senior undergraduate student at Boğaziçi University.

# For more details about each project, please refer to the respective folders.

## Assignments
- **Assignment 1**: Segmentation and Connected Components Analysis using pure mathematical morphology operations.
- **Assignment 2**: Image stitching using Homography estimation.
- **Assignment 3**: Feature extraction and classification using SIFT and Bag of Visual Words. Also using Swin Transformer as a feature extractor for comparison.
- **Assignment 4**: A simple generative model using Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders to generate MNIST-like images.
